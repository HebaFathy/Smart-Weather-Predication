# Smart-Weather-Predication

For any people, predicting the weather through observation has been a necessary part of life. Observing and then analyzing the atmosphere to gain an understanding is a scientific way of thinking. Peoplesâ€™ observations, explanations and understanding of the weather have naturally led to weather forecasts.

Using matlab to apply neural network RBF and Backpropagation for weather predication.
A traditional RBF network takes Gaussian functions as its basis functions and adopts the least-squares criterion as the objective function.
The backpropagation method is a popular technique to train multi-layer feed-forward neural networks in a supervised manner.
